        "In AI, RL is a framework of **learning via interaction**, often trying to **maximize the reinforcing reward**. Humans and animals alike sort of naturally follow the paradigm in learning behaviors. We reward a dog for doing a trick via a positive reward signal by giving it a treat. We penalize a dog for peeing on the floor by giving a negative reward signal (saying no!) or giving no reward. For a fun video of reinforcement learning you can watch this chicken below immediately learn to peck a particular colored dot via reinforcing it's actions with food."

        "\n",
        "We discretize time in an environment into individual **time steps** labeled as `t` below. At each time step, the agent uses the current environment observation (also known as state) $S_t$ to produce an action $A_t$ and executes that action in the environment. The environment updates in response to the action and gives the agent a new observation $S_{t+1}$ as well as a reward signal $R_{t+1}$ telling the agent how well it is doing. Eventually the environment will tell the agent it is completed and this completes one full episode.\n",

Training in RL requires balancing exploration and exploitation. While the overall goal of the agent is to exploit and to **maximize return** (the sum of rewards in an episode), you can easily learn suboptimal behaviors if you don't explore sufficiently in an environment to find better strategies. This explore vs exploitation problem is a foundational problem in RL that is still researched to this day.\n",

The particular algorithm used above is called PPO and has been a staple of the RL research community as it is generally easy to tune and very robust. However it is very **sample inefficient**, meaning it needs many many environment interactions in order to learn something. One way of dealing with this problem is to simply scale up the training by making it run faster.
